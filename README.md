# FEDS(File Encryption Decryption System)

"FEDS" refers to the file encryption and decryption system, which is a program to encrypt and decrypt text files.
The encryption part of the program uses VigenÃ¨re Cipher and Rail Fence Cipher as the means of encoding the data. It will encode the files according to the key/depth given by the user. 
For the development of FEDS, C++ shall be used for the back end and Qt for the designing the front-end.

**This Project can only operate with .txt files for now!**

## Deployment
Release **FEDSv1"** already has deployed exe folder

#### If the exe file doesn't run

```bash
  FEDSv1>debug folder>copy encdec.exe>create new folder(exe)>paste encdec.exe

  Open Qt(MinGW)cmd> cd <file location for the exe folder>
  windeployqt.exe>windeployqt.exe . >exit

  Open exe folder > run encdec.exe
```
